The current work revisits the point in polygon problem by providing a novel solution that explicitly employs the properties of epigraphs and hypographs. Using concepts of epigraphs and hypographs, this manuscript provides a new definition of inaccessibility and inside, to accurately specify the meaning of inclusion of a point within or without a polygon. Via PoincarÂ´eâ€™s ideas on homotopy and Hopfâ€™s Degree Theorem from topology, a relationship between inaccessibility and inside is established and it is shown that consistent results are obtained for peculiar cases of both non-intersecting and self-intersecting polygons while investigating the point inclusion test w.r.t a polygon. Through illustrative examples, the novel method addresses the issues of  ambiguous solutions given by the cross over for both non-intersecting and self-intersecting polygons and  a point being labeled as multi-ply inside a self intersecting polygon by the winding number rule, by providing an unambiguous and singular result for both kinds of polygons. The proposed solution bridges the gap between cross-over and winding number rule for complex cases.
